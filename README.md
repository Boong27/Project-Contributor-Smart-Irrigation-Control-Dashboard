# 🌱 Project-Contributor-Smart-Irrigation-Control-Dashboard

A lightweight, frontend-based dashboard simulating an **intelligent irrigation control system** for smart farming applications.

> ✅ Inspired by real-world microcontroller logic (e.g., ATMEGA128), this system offers live sensor simulation, farm zone mapping, and emergency pump control.

- Interactive **farm map** with click-to-view camera zones
- Emergency pump shutoff control

### 📦 Sensor Data from JSON
- Reads sensor values from `/data/sensor.json`
- Simulates multi-zone readings (Zone A, B, C)

### 📡 Camera Simulation
- Click on a zone → shows pre-defined camera snapshot
- Simulates surveillance integration for each field
